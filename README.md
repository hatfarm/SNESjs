# SNESjs
A Javascript SNES emulator.

Currently, it does not support many of the instructions the SNES does, but it is on its way.  No sound and no video yet.

To run, just use build_and_start_server.sh which builds the content with webpack and spawns an express server to serve up the content on port 3000
